        <li>It is the version of me who has accomplished alot and loves anime. People who want a greater insight into me as a developer and a person. I chose a flat structure as I felt it was the mmost appropriate with the lack of complexity.</li>
        <li><ul>
            <li>https://robbowen.digital/ - Very thematic, I was inspired to also base my website on a theme.</li>
            <li>https://m7mad.dev/ - I loved the responsiveness in this website and tried to implement my navigation in a similar manner</li>
            <li>https://travthebav.github.io/portfolio/ - super creative</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><ul>
            <li>Great amount of contrast</li>
            <li>It is simple so people are unlikely to be overwhelmed</li>
            <li>In comparison to other colours, black and white have a high level of accesibility across browsers</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><ul><li>My site is responsive, accomodating for screen sizes from mobile to desktop</li>
        <li>Contrast</li>
        <li>Due to all pages having similar layouts, the user is automatically familiarised with navigation</li></ul></li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side suthentication. Great videos on it, and building up on concepts</li>
                <li>Making a site more usable by establishing familiarity</li>
                <li>CSS animations - doing research online</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The theme, I believe this was an excellent design choice that combo'd well with the title</li>
        <li>The header, I could have used a JS file to load in the header, it'd have made the code cleaner</li>
